### Welcome to my webpage!

Hello visitor, you have safely landed on the personal page of Adrien Corenflos (me). 
If this is not what you expected, don't leave just yet, I don't have cookies, 
but I have a short [CV](/cv/) and a list of [publications](/research/).

#### About me
In case you are still here reading, here's a few facts about me. I am a Ph.D. student at Aalto University, working in [Prof. Simo Särkkä's](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/) group, in Finland. I will be defending my thesis on August 26th, 2024. 
I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at Warwick University, under Prof. Gareth Roberts, as part of the [OCEAN](https://oceanerc.com/) project.
Prior to this I was working as a quantitative researcher for J.P. Morgan in London, and focused mostly on statistical modelling of corporate credit markets (essentially modeling of online auctions).

[Research-wise](/research/) I like all things sampling, all things optimal transport, and all things parallel. I do find the smell of a GPU burning through matrix multiplications weirdly comforting, and typically try finding new principled ways to indulge in this.

If you want to contact me for a reason or another, see the [contact page](/contact/).

Here is a picture of [mushrooms](puffballs.jpg). I like mushrooms.
